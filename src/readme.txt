Hi


12.09.2006:

This is a early port of Airstrike 1.00pre6a taken from icculus.org/airstrike for the GP2X.

The Graphics are converted using image magick.
I just did "-resize 50%" for all images except the background images
and the fonts.

Controls:

Select    -   Exit
Start     -   Toggle Menu (Menu will become more or less obsolete in next release)

Steering:

LEFT/RIGHT   -      UP/DOWN

X            -      Accelerate
L            -      Fire
B            -      Drop bomb

That's for it now.

Hope you like it.

I have cleaned up the menu.
Now you can toggle audio on/off, resume and quit the qame.
I turned alpha on, and the graphics are now very pretty.

This is a release build with oopo's sdk, which 
means, this release is hardware accelerated.

SLECT no longer quits the game.
Exit via Menu.
